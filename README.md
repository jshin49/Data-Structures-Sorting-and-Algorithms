# Data-Structures-and-Sorting
This set of libraries is strictly purpose for studying basic data structures and sorting methods.

Implemented with C++ 11, I made it simple just for integers, and maybe later change it to templates.

Two of the librairies: bstmap.hpp and hashtablemap.hpp are implemented as a template, but they are quite inefficient and incomplete in some ways.

Any suggestions of improvements are welcome.

The rest are implemented with vector<int> which is typedefined as Array.

# Data Structures
 - Singly/Doubly Linked Lists
 - Stacks
 - Queues
 - Heaps (With Priority Queue Interface included)
 - Binary Search Trees
 - Hash Maps
 - Graphs

# Sorting
- Merge sort
- Quick sort
- Heap sort
- Counting sort
- Bucket sort
- Naive Sorting
  - Insertion sort
  - Selection sort
  - Bubble sort
