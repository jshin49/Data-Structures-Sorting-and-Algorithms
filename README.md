# Data-Structures-Sorting-and-Algorithms
This set of libraries is strictly purpose for studying basic data structures and sorting methods.

Implemented with C++ 11, I made it simple just for integers, and maybe later change it to templates.

Two of the librairies: bstmap.hpp and hashtablemap.hpp are implemented as a template, but they are quite inefficient and incomplete in some ways.

Any suggestions of improvements are welcome.

In some implementations, vector<int> is typedefined as Array.

The main.cpp includes test procedures.
